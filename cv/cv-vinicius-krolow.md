I've been programming for over a decade and during that time, I'm always learning and teaching. My main focus is to write simple code, for me, simple code leads to, and is itself: reliable, maintainable and simple to read (good readability).

I'm not a fan boy of any technology, but I like to learn new languages, techniques and technologies to be able to pick the best option for a given job.

I can lead teams, and I can follow. I can work alone or in groups. I can architecture or follow others architectures.

I'm totally passionate about what I do, I do it also as a hobby when I'm not working.
